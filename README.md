## Future iterations:
1. Show Fireworks when winning
2. Allow player to choose different images as icon 
3. Support custom board sizes: default is 3x3 but you could allow users to choose a larger board
4. Make the start button earth / moon
5. Add pvp mode
6. Add option to let computer move first
7. Make sure the display is correct for different resolutions: (use view height?)
8. Further Refactoring of code:

9. Add hidden Galaga game mode after winning several rounds of Tic Tac Toe.

15. Draw lines using background colour instead of a picture, and set a timer to change colour gradients of the line continuously
16. Make the background starry universe shine and stars in the universe moving against the screen continuously (code train?)
17. Make the lines repeatedly fade in and out once the game starts
